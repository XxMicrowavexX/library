# library
a basic library library *hehe*

clone the project then run
```bash
cargo build --release
```

There is a compiled version for Macos

This project isn't a crate its just 2 rust files that you can put in your application

```
content.rs
library.rs
```

if you just want to check it out you can edit the ```main.rs``` file
